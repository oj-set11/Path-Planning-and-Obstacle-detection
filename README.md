# Path-Planning-and-Obstacle-detection

• An Embedded system (using Arduino IDE, and Java) with RF technology to guide visually impaired reach indoor destinations unlike the GPS, which only works for outdoors.
• Integrated Ultrasonic sensors and IR sensors to detect the presence of obstacles, find a suitable path and vocally communicate it to the user using the audio module.
• Localization of the user, by using the triangulation process and programmed to generate navigation, considering the environment settings.
